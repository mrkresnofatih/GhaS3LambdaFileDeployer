# Github Action: Upload S3 Lambda File Deployer

## What is it

It's a project for automating upload AWS lambda files to an AWS S3 Bucket and also update the asset of an existing lambda function to the file we just uploaded. Technically, this is a CICD tool. First of all, this isn't necessarily a github action but you can use it in your github workflow using the `docker run` command since this is planned as a docker image. 

## How to use it

You can use it in your github workflow using the `docker run` command since this is planned as a docker image. With that in mind, you can literally use this in any workflow or even in your own laptop rather than a CICD runner.

`Sorry, the steps on how to use this will be displayed after an official release is published.`
